# Tracker introduction

The Lyticus tracker is a tiny JavaScript library that enables you to tracks various metrics such as [page views](/tracker/methods.md#tracking-page-views) and [clicks](/tracker/methods.md#tracking-clicks).

It is flexible and easily configurable: you control which events to track and when to track them.

The tracker for Lyticus is open-source, your suggestions and pull requests are welcome via [Github](https://github.com/byteboomers/lyticus-tracker).
